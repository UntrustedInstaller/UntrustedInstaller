ðŸ‘‹ Hey. I'm UntrustedInstaller. Professional Dumbass. <br>
<br>
I'm a tech enthusiast with a short attention span. <br>
I'm especially interested in legacy hardware and software, retro gaming, game development, and metal <br>
I'm not that much of an interesting person, but I try to do the things I like and make other people happy.
